## Project Overview
This project implements an interactive web application that helps medical professionals analyze breast tissue data for cancer detection. Using advanced machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques, our system provides real-time analysis and predictions.

## Understanding Breast Cancer
Breast cancer develops when cells in breast tissue begin to grow abnormally. These cells can:
- Divide more rapidly than healthy cells
- Continue to accumulate, forming tumors
- Spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body through lymph nodes

While breast cancer predominantly affects women, it can also occur in men. Early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes, making diagnostic tools crucial for healthcare providers.

## Key Statistics (2023 Data)
### Global Impact
- **Asia Pacific Region**: 
  - 45% of global cases
  - Highest mortality rate at 49%

- **North America**: 
  - 15% of global cases
  - Advanced detection methods leading to better survival rates

- **Europe**: 
  - 25% of global cases
  - Highest early detection rates

### Risk Factors
- Age: Risk increases after 50
- Family history: Genetic factors play a crucial role
- Lifestyle factors: Diet, exercise, and environmental conditions
